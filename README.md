# Reddit Clone

## Preview
You can preview my project: https://reddit-frontend-c6808.web.app/

## Description
This project is a front-end clone of the social media site Reddit, developed with React.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and React-Router by me.
I am planning on adding the back-end support to it in the future, but for now it is only the front-end design which is mobile responsive.

## To Run the Code Locally
