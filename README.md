# Reddit Clone

## Preview
You can preview the front-end design at (Doesn't interact with a back-end but the design is almost complete.): https://reddit-frontend-c6808.web.app/

## Description
This project is a clone of the front-end of social media site Reddit, developed with React.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and React-Router.
I am planning on adding the back-end support to it in the future, but for now it is only the front-end design which is mobile responsive.
